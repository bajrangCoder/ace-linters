This is just sample websocket server based on vscode-json-languageserver

## Getting Started
To run the server, simply follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies by running `npm i`
2. Start the server by running `npm run start-server`

And that's it! Your sample language server on 3000 port should now be up and running.
